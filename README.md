# terraform-minecraft-plugin

This is a Spigot plugin for enabling the Terraform Minecraft provider. You can either build this code yourself with a `mvn install` or you can download the latest jar file from the tagged releases tab. To install this, you must be running a Spigot minecraft server and copy the jar file into the ~/plugins directory of your server files. Reload the plugins (or restart the server and the plugin will be enabled. This starts up a server on default port 8080, although this can be changed in the plugin configuration files. Once this has been started up, you will be able to use the Terraform Minecraft provider. If you are having difficulties, please file an issue and I can update the Readme accordingly.
